# Anagram
Checks if two words are anagrams.

The console application expects two strings and outputs "match" or "mismatch" if two words are anagrams.

The idea is to represent a string (ASCII only) as a multiplication of unique prime numbers that have been assigned to each alphabet character. The comparison boils down to integer comparison.
